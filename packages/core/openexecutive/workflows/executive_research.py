"""ExecutiveResearchWorkflow — specialists research, Executive routes.

Mirrors the architecture of ``executive_reflection.py``: a research
phase produces structured findings, then the Executive enters a tool-
use loop with its full outbound toolkit (``_ALL_SKILL_HANDLERS``) and
decides per finding whether to:

  - DM a specific Person via ``message_person`` (pass the ``person_id``
    from ``lookup_person``; the server resolves their real channel id)
  - Message a department channel via ``send_department_message``
  - Surface as a briefing card via ``create_alert``
  - Propose an ongoing source to monitor via ``propose_watch`` (a dedicated
    pass after routing; deterministic policy in
    ``monitoring.research.watch_policy`` decides whether a proposal is added
    on its own or shown to the principal as a suggestion)
  - Schedule a follow-up via ``schedule_followup``
  - Propose a deeper workflow via ``suggest_workflow``
  - Ignore (passive — no tool call)

The Executive — not the workflow — owns routing decisions. The
specialists surface, the Executive acts. Same pattern executive_reflection
already uses on org-state signals; the only new piece is the upstream
research phase that produces the findings.

Pipeline:
  1. ``gather_context`` — load company profile, active initiatives,
     existing watchlist (so specialists don't re-propose what's already
     monitored).
  2. ``research_specialists`` — fan out via asyncio.gather to seven
     specialists (cso, cfo, cmo, coo, chro, cpo, gc). Each runs with
     web_search + the ``emit_research_findings`` tool.
  3. ``dedup`` — light cross-specialist dedup so the Executive doesn't
     see the same fact twice.
  4. ``executive_synthesis`` — Executive's tool-use loop. Reads
     findings, fires the right tools per finding.
  5. ``emit_artifact`` — short Markdown summary of "what I researched
     + what I did about it".

        "stock / edgar watch the entity is the ticker itself (e.g. 'ACME').\n"

        "a target listed under DECLINED.\n"
